                <p>Before the 1970’s, standard methods for network communication did not exist. It was not until computer 
                    engineers Vint Carf and Bob Kahn came up with the internetworking protocols rules and regulations. 
                    Protocols allow the communication to happen with a set of well-known standards between machines to adapt 
                    and absorb new technologies. All devices on the internet have an unique address on the network. 
                    These unique addresses are called Internet Protocol (IP) and are used in Internet communication. 
                    They send the information from one network to another using the IP addresses. Think of IP addresses as 
                    your device’s mailing address. To send over an image or data, you need the sender’s and receiver’s IP 
                    address in order to properly receive the data.</p>
                
                <p>There are two versions of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 was designed in 1973 and is made up of 32 bits. 
                    Each 8 bits is represented by country, region, subnet, then by device. IPv4 provides more than four billion 
                    unique addresses, but still not enough for all devices. IPv6 was introduced and is now in a multiyear 
                    transition with the IP addresses using 128 bits making more than 340 decillion unique addresses</p>

                <p>Now that we know how the destination of each device is declared, let's dive into how the information is sent 
                    from computer to computer. The internet transfers data through ‘packets’ of information that are not in a 
                    fixed path. The packets take different paths depending on how much traffic is on each path. When the information 
                    being sent is too big, the packet is broken down into smaller packets and sent out. The distributed packets travel 
                    at various speeds and paths until they all reach the destination. Once there, the packets are reassembled. 
                    For example, when a users sends a large image to another user, that image is broken down into the packets. 
                    The packets are sent to the receiving user, put together, and then the user can see the image on their device.</p>

                <p>For packets to move smoothly through the path, routers are put in place to act as traffic managers. 
                    When one router is congested, the packet is sent to another router with less traffic. In terms of time, 
                    politics, and relationship, routers choose the cheapest available path for each piece of data for the IP address. 
                    Because of this, packets will arrive at different times. If the packets do not arrive at the destination, 
                    the packet is sent until it is received. To ensure all data have arrived at the destination, 
                    Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) confirms its arrival. TCP will send back a full inventory of the packets 
                    received to the sender, and send an acknowledgement all packets were received. TCP and Routers are scalable and 
                    reliable to send packets to and from IP addresses.</p>
